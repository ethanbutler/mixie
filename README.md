## What is Rotato? :confused:

Rotato is a WordPress theme for experimenting with design mockups by letting you mix-and-match options. This is intended for use with both wireframes and designs.

You can add multiple options for different page elements via a gallery field. You can add as many page elements and options as you want. Page element options can be uploaded as flat JPGs or PNGs.

On the front-end, you can drag options left or right, which will cause the option to rotate to the previous or next option in the sequence. (This works on touch devices, too!) This works by making a request to the WP API that returns the new image.

If you find a combination you particularly like, you can share the current URL and that combination will load by default when anyone visits that link – whenever you rotate an option, your changes are reflected in the URL hash via the History API.

## What's included? :package:

You'll get an `index.php` file which will show a list of all your mockups.

You'll get a `single.php` file which will show individual mockups – the theme uses Posts for mockups.

Finally, you'll also get all the fields you need for your mockups pre-registered.

## Requirements :wrench:

This theme requires WordPress version 4.4 or later.

Rotato requires [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) to be installed, though I hope to release a version which uses open-source meta fields in the future.

## Demo :construction:

I'll add a demo soon, I promise!
